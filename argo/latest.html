          <h3>A Brief Primer on Servers</h3>
          <em>By Asuna Yuki</em> </header>
        <p> A question that I have often been asked by players is, "What are the
          differences between servers?" As most players have never ventured
          outside their original server, this is a fair question. First though,
          a little background.</p>
        <p>Sword of Chaos uses a system called <em>sharding</em>. This system,
          and indeed several other technical aspects of <abbr>SoC</abbr> were
          first developed for the <abbr>MMORPG</abbr> Ultima Online. Each shard
          consists of of one database host and any number of processing hosts,
          all physically housed at the same physical location for best
          performance. It is presently unknown if the chat system is a separate
          host or not. The database host stores all the players' data, including
          stats, inventory, and guild membership. The processing hosts, also
          known as <em>subservers</em>, handle the game's logic, AI, and
          graphics. The reason players can only see the avatars of other players
          on the same subserver is because each one renders the main city area
          independently. The term "server line" in reference to subservers
          originates from the fact that in Ultima Online, the world map is
          partitioned into sections, and the player would be assigned the
          subserver that corresponded with wherever their avatar was. The
          invisible demarcations between these areas came to be known as server
          lines.</p>
        <p>The game's network probably looks something like this:</p>
        <p> <img src="media/SoC_network.svg" style="width:800px"></p>
        <p>What is actually different for the player, aside from perhaps slight
          differences in lag, is really just the other players on the server. No
          user data, not even VIP status, is shared between servers. They do use
          a unified login, but there is absolutely no system to port a character
          over from one server to another.</p>
        <p>Servers, in addition to their name, are numbered sequentially, in the
          order of when they were first brought online. Therefore, the lower the
          server's number is, the more time the oldest players there have had to
          level up, and therefore the more powerful the top players are on
          average. That can be intimidating, or even discouraging, to a new
          player. Because of that, as well as the desire to balance the
          per-server load, most of the time a new player will be directed to the
          newest server on the network.</p>
        <p>Other than that, there are no consistent differences between the game
          experience on the different servers. While it is true that the
          character of the social experience is a product of the users, in my
          analysis and experience, any notion that some servers are "tougher" or
          "less serious" than others, is a misnomer. ⚔ </p>
